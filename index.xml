My name is Rebecca Seraphine. I am a German artist and illustrator who loves creating colourful works. Nature and adventure are my inspiration and the heart of my creations. I make digital drawings, watercolour paintings and recently I published my very first adult colouring book! Outside my colourful world, I am also a frontend developer and houseplant lover, living in my indoor jungle.</description></item><item><title>Free Colouring Page - Crysanthemum</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/creative-corner/chrysanthemum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:34:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/creative-corner/chrysanthemum/</guid><description>You can download this colouring page below and it&amp;rsquo;s completely free for personal use.

Speed doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as long as you&amp;rsquo;re making progress!&amp;rdquo; This illustration was inspired by the quote above that I heard from a good friend during a time when creating art besides working my regular job was really challenging. Because this little piece of wisdom helped me to keep going, I felt inspired to create a collection around uplifting quotes and thoughts, hoping to share their happiness and positivity.</description></item><item><title>Eagle Knight</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/eagle-knight/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/eagle-knight/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Buffalo Chief</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/buffalo-chief/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/buffalo-chief/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cat Princess</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/cat-princess/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 18:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/cat-princess/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Coyote Mage</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/coyote-mage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/coyote-mage/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Manta Scout</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/manta-scout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/manta-scout/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Turtle Sage</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/turtle-sage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/turtle-sage/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Elephant Warrior</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/warrior-elephant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/warrior-elephant/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Shaman Wolf</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/shaman-wolf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/shaman-wolf/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Chinese Mouse</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/chinese-mouse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/chinese-mouse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Flaming Fox</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/flaming-fox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/flaming-fox/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Boho Bear</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/boho-bear/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/boho-bear/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jungle Jaguar</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/jungle-jaguar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/jungle-jaguar/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Guru Goat</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/guru-goat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/guru-goat/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hero Horse</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/hero-horse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/hero-horse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cat Love</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/cat-love/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/cat-love/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jumping Deer</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/jumping-deer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/jumping-deer/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Arctic Tern</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/arctic-tern/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/arctic-tern/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Colourful Butterfly</title><link>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/colourful-butterfly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 17:34:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://seraphine-arts.com/illustrations/colourful-butterfly/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>

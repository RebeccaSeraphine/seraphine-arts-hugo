"Grow at your own pace. Speed doesn't matter as long as you're making progress!" 
\

This illustration was inspired by the quote above that I heard from a good friend during a time when creating art besides working my regular job was really challenging. Because this little piece of wisdom helped me to keep going, I felt inspired to create a collection around uplifting quotes and thoughts, hoping to share their happiness and positivity. I created the collection "Flowers of Inspiration" with this illustration as the first one.

# A little bit about myself

Nice to meet you! My name is Rebecca Seraphine. I am a German artist and illustrator who loves creating colourful works. Nature and adventure are my inspiration and the heart of my creations. I make digital drawings, watercolour paintings and recently I published my very first adult colouring book! Outside my colourful world, I am also a frontend developer and houseplant lover, living in my indoor jungle.
